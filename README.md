<h1>Workshop FortiCNP - EKS Use Case </h1>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>
The main purpose of this project is to create an EKS cluster with a flaw application to explore some vulnerabilities and see how FortiCNP can support you during your cloud security operation. 
</p>
<p><strong> FortiCNP </strong> is a new Fortinet Cloud Native Protection product that is designed to help you address todayâ€™s cloud security needs by integrating with Cloud Native Security services as well as Fortinet Security Fabric products.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The following  resources will be deployed into your AWS account:</p>


<strong>VPC</strong>
* 1 x VPC
* 4 x Subnets. 2 Publics and 2 Privates
* 2 x Route Tables
* 1 x Nat Gateway
* 1 x IGW

<strong>EKS Cluster</strong>
* 1 EKS Cluster with a single WorkerNode

<strong> IAM </strong>
* IAM User for EKS Cluster management

<strong> Bastion EC2 Instance </strong>
* 1x EC2 Instance for EKS cluster api access/management


<h3>Use Case</h3>

<p>In this use case, we will discuss the risks of the AWS Instance Metadata service in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. We will demonstrate that deploying a flaw application with misconfiguration of AWS resources such as IAM policies can have disastrous consequences in the AWS account.</p>
<p><a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html> Instance Metadata service </a> is an AWS API listening on a link-local IP address, 169.254.169.254. It is only accessible from EC2 instances and allows to retrieve many information about them.</p>

<h3>Deploy AWS Resources</h3>
<p>Follow the deployment process below to deploy EKS cluster in your AWS Account </p>
<ul>
<li>1. Deploy the cloudformation template Activate_AWSQS_extentation.yaml</li>
<li>2. Deploy the cloudformation template EKS.yaml</li>
</ul>
