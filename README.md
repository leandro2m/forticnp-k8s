<h1>Workshop FortiCNP - EKS Use Case </h1>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>
The main purpose of this project is to create an EKS cluster with a flaw application to explore some vulnerabilities and see how FortiCNP can support you during your cloud security operation. 
</p>
<p><strong> FortiCNP </strong> is a new Fortinet Cloud Native Protection product that is designed to help you address todayâ€™s cloud security needs by integrating with Cloud Native Security services as well as Fortinet Security Fabric products.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The following  resources will be deployed into your AWS account:</p>


<strong>VPC</strong>
* 1 x VPC
* 4 x Subnets. 2 Publics and 2 Privates
* 2 x Route Tables
* 1 x Nat Gateway
* 1 x IGW

<strong>EKS Cluster</strong>
* 1 EKS Cluster with a single WorkerNode

<strong> IAM </strong>
* IAM User for EKS Cluster management

<strong> Bastion EC2 Instance </strong>
* 1x EC2 Instance for EKS cluster api access/management


<h3>Use Case</h3>

<p>In this use case, we will discuss the risks of the AWS Instance Metadata service in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. We will demonstrate that deploying a flaw application with misconfiguration of AWS resources such as IAM policies can have disastrous consequences in the AWS account.</p>
<p><a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html> Instance Metadata service </a> is an AWS API listening on a link-local IP address, 169.254.169.254. It is only accessible from EC2 instances and allows to retrieve many information about them.</p>

<h3>Deploy AWS Resources</h3>
<p>Follow the deployment process below to deploy EKS cluster in your AWS Account </p>
<ul>
<li>1. Deploy the cloudformation template Activate_AWSQS_extentation.yaml</li>
<li>2. Deploy the cloudformation template EKS.yaml</li>
It will take around 20 minutes to complete.
</ul>

<h3>Deploy Application</h3>
<p>Follow the  process below to deploy a flaw application on top of EKS</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Connect to an EC2 Bastion host created. If you have Key Pair you can use it to connect through SSH. If not, use Connect button available in the console</li>
<li>2. Open the folder forticnp-k8s/application available in the root path.</li>
<li>3. Deploy the application with the following command.
kubectl create -f deployment_k8s_attack.yaml
</li>
<li>4. Deploy the service to expose the application with the following command.
kubectl create -f service_k8s_attack.yaml
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod</h3>
<ul>
<li>1. Open the application URL. Get the URL with the command below.
<p> kubectl get svc service-k8s-attack</p>
<img src='/get_service.PNG'>
</li>
<li>2. Launch http://your_url_service:8080.

</li>
<li>3. You can explore Instance Metadata. Copy and paste the command below in the form that will return informations about the EKS WorkerNode
curl http://169.254.169.254/meta-data/iam/
</li>
</ul>
